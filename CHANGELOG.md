## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Default template was empty, causing `show` and other display commands to produce no output without explicit template
  config
- Default template now includes colors (`%boldwhite`, `%boldcyan`, `%cyan`) matching the Ruby doing gem style
- [#18] `archive` and `rotate` commands only process `@done` entries instead of all entries
- [#19] `again` command selects last `@done` entry instead of last unfinished entry
- [#20] `tag`, `note`, `mark`, and `last` commands operate on `@done` entries instead of skipping them
- [#21] `reset` command does not remove `@done` tag by default, requiring explicit `--resume` flag
- [#23] Undo history is not isolated per doing file; undoing in one file can restore content from a different file
- [#24] `reset` command crashes with `--search`, `--back`, or `--from` flags when search config is not explicitly set
